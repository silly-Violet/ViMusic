bugs:

modify shows a shorter duration than it should however still plays normally (it fixed itself? no for some reason specifically the one in my test folder is bugged, actually no again it's just weird idk)

stop didn't pause once

after song ends play doesn't replay it anymore





features:

make icon for app (music note?)

modify tab indexes so it's natural to move with only keyboard

add settings for things like hover cooldown

add tray icon and ability to hide main window and show from tray right click option

save volume to be loaded next time, along with settings once implimented

loop playlist and individual song
